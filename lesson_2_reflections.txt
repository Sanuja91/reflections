What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Creates a .git file and adds it to the git system. IF you don't do it then the version control system will not work?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to to add files to the area allowing you to select which files will be included together in a single commit. Working area is after the staging area where you essentially keep adding commits with changes and track the changes made
