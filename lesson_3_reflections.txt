When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When multiple people are contributing to the project. Just in case you loose all the fils, you would want to keep an online backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there could be unexpected changes occuring in the code that might disrupt your latest changes automatically and simply make the process more tiresome.
