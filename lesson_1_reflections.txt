How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It easily wrote out the lines of code that were newly added and what was removed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Whenever I break my code I can return to a preivous working version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

PROS
- Manual savings allows you to save at the most appropriate times ideally when there has been a single logical change to the code

CONS
- Human error of committing too often or not enough

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is designed ideally for coding situations hence saving multiple inter-related files is very important. Google Docs was not desgined with this in mind

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git Log can be used to view the commits made along with their messages saved by the user

Git Diff can be used to view the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Version control will allow me to be more confident in implementing changes and experimenting with the code as I know if I break the code, I can return to a previous versino that worked

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Android programming
